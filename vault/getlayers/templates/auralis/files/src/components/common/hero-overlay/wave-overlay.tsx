/**
 * Wave-scene overlay body — recreated from the Figma frame "Get Layers" 793:256 (styles/spacing
 * preserved, copy rewritten). Shares `SiteHeader`; cross-faded in by `ScrollFade` while the wave
 * curtain is the on-screen act. The whole block sits in the **right half** (the wave falls to the
 * lower-left): a **right-aligned heading** near the top, a **tagline**, and a **2×2 grid of solid
 * white work cards** (`bg-overlay-ink` + black `text-overlay-solid`, number + one-line description).
 *
 * **Disappears by _clip_, not opacity** — as the tree wipes in, the overlay is clipped along the same
 * tilted wipe line, so the tree appears to cover it. **One `clip-path` on this root**, not per element:
 * the root is `inset-0`, i.e. exactly the viewport, so the wipe line's on-screen `y` (in % of viewport
 * height, from `wipeLineAt`) *is* the local percentage — no per-element geometry, nothing to cache, and
 * nothing to go stale. `none` while the line is still off the bottom.
 *
 * > It was briefly clipped **per element** to protect the cards' `backdrop-filter` (a `clip-path` on an
 * > ancestor makes it a backdrop-root and kills descendants' blur). The cards are opaque now, so that
 * > no longer applies — and per-element clipping actively broke once the reveals landed: it cached each
 * > element's `getBoundingClientRect()`, which by then included the reveal spring's `translateY`, so
 * > every local percentage was offset; and it put `clip-path` on the same elements carrying
 * > `filter: blur()`, which smeared cards clipped down to a sliver into horizontal bands over the next
 * > scene. Clipping the root keeps the animation and the clip on separate elements.
 *
 * (`HomeView` gives it no `disappear` window — the clip is what removes it.)
