/**
 * Preloader — a black hold over the whole page until the 3D scene is worth looking at.
 *
 * Minimal on purpose, and in the site's own language: the black of `--overlay-solid`, the display
 * face, extra-light uppercase letter-spaced type, and one hairline rule — the same rule motif the
 * header and the hero footer use. Nothing spins.
 *
 * **It tracks a real signal, not a timer.** `useSceneProgress` reports the scene's three gating steps
 * (hand cloud, tree cloud, warm-up pass), so the rule fills against actual work and the hand-off lands
 * on a frame that is complete — after the shaders have compiled, which is the stall the warm-up exists
 * to hide. A missing asset still counts as settled, so a failed fetch can never trap the page here.
 *
 * All motion is spring-based (hard rule #1): the rule's width and the veil's fade are springs, and the
 * count is derived from the same spring value rather than a second timer, so the number can never
 * disagree with the bar. Once faded it is `pointer-events-none` and removed from the tree.

  // ready the exit is guaranteed even if the spring's `onRest` never arrives (a backgrounded tab
  // freezes rAF, and react-spring rides it).
  // Wait for the **bar itself** to reach full, by polling the spring on rAF.
  //
  // Two simpler approaches both failed. `onRest` runs the callback captured by the render that
  // *started* the animation, so it read a stale `progress` and the veil never left. A wall-clock
  // `setTimeout` fires in a background tab where rAF — and therefore the spring — is frozen, so it
  // yanked the veil while the bar still read 058. Polling on rAF is measured in the same clock the
  // spring runs on: it can't fire early, and it can't hang, because the spring always converges.
