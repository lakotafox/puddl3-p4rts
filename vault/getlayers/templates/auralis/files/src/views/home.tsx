/**
 * Home view — a full-viewport 3D particle scene driven by scroll.
 *
 * The `<ParticleScene>` canvas is pinned to the viewport (`fixed`) while a
 * spacer below it gives the page its scroll length; the scene reads scroll
 * progress to fly the camera, scatter the glyph, and reveal the hand. Over it,
 * `<HeroLights>` adds two blended, cursor-parallaxing light flares, `<Grain>` lays
 * film grain over the scenes (below the UI), a persistent
 * `<SiteHeader>`, and per-scene UI overlays (`<HeroOverlay>` for the glyph,
 * `<HandOverlay>` for the hand, `<WaveOverlay>` for the wave) that `<ScrollFade>`
 * cross-fades with scroll so each shows only while its scene is on screen. A dev-only `<TuningPanel>`
 * (mounts with `?tune`) live-tweaks the pink particles + bloom. All are client-safe leaves, so
 * this view stays a Server Component (hard rule #6). One `sr-only` `<h1>` names
 * the landmark; the visible headings are decorative.
