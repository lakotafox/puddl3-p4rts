 * page (hard rule #5 / [[decisions-log]] ADR-0003).
 *
 * `titleAbsolute` because `siteConfig.title` is already the whole title; run
 * through the layout's `%s — Splitsecond` template it would name the studio
 * twice.
 * Everything else — description, canonical, the share card — comes from the
 * generator's defaults, which are this page's anyway.
