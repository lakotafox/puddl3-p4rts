 * The first screen's words: the headline high in the frame, and a bottom-anchored
 * column of cross, intro and buttons.
 *
 * Straight from the Figma frame (node `1097:251`): headline **Big Shoulders
 * Inline 72/1.0** in `#dbfffe` on a **535px** measure — one string, wrapped by
 * that measure rather than hand-broken — held **97px** down: the nav pill ends
 * at 57 (16 + 41) and the brief is a **40px** gap under it. Measured from the
 * top rather than from the centre, so that gap is the same on any window height
 * — the nav is `fixed` to the top, and a centre-anchored headline drifts away
 * from it. Under it, 32×32 crosshair, 16px, the intro at **Chakra Petch Regular
 * 16/1.2** on a **411px** measure, 31.6px, then the buttons 12px apart, the
 * group sitting **50px** off the bottom.
 *
 * **It does not travel.** It used to be absolute inside the tall section, so the
 * scroll carried it up and out of frame — which reads as the words being pulled
 * off the page while the room behind them holds still. It is `fixed` now and
 * **stays where it is**: the bottom column goes out on blur and opacity over the
 * first of the flight, and the headline — which arrived on nothing but its
 * letters — leaves on nothing but its letters too.
 *
 * The fade is written **straight to the element** off the shared ticker, the
 * same bargain the panels and the readouts strike; the only thing React is told
 * is whether the headline should be resolved or scattered, which is a boolean
 * that flips once.
 *
 * **Narrow, the two measures become margins.** The 535px headline and the 411px
 * intro are what break the copy into its lines on the design's window; on a
 * phone they are wider than the window itself, and a centred block wider than
 * its frame runs off *both* edges at once. Under `sm` each one is the window
 * less a gutter, so the same copy breaks into more lines instead of into the
 * bezel. The column also stands further off the foot than the design's 50px:
 * the frame's date and clock are down there, and at a phone's root size the
 * buttons were landing on them.
