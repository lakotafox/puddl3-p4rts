 * The window's chrome: a hairline frame with bracketed corners, and four
 * readouts.
 *
 * Every number is the Figma frame's (node `1097:251`): rules inset **16px** that
 * stop **48px** short of each corner, **32×32** brackets filling those gaps, and
 * the readouts **32px** in — Chakra Petch Regular **16px**, white. In `rem`, so
 * the whole thing rides the adaptive grid: at the 1440 base `1rem` is the
 * design's 16px. See [[design-system]].
 *
 * `fixed`, not part of the scroll: it is the window's frame, not the hero's, and
 * it stays over every act of the scene. `pointer-events-none` throughout —
 * nothing here is clickable, and a full-screen overlay that swallowed the
 * pointer would take the scene's hover with it.
 *
 * **On a phone the frame tightens and the top row loses its two readouts.** The
 * 16/48/32 rhythm is a share of a 1440px window; kept at a phone's root size it
 * is a two-centimetre border on a five-centimetre screen. And the top row has
 * the nav pill down its middle: at 390px the pill is 240 of them, which leaves
 * the corners about 70px each — not enough for `60 fps` and `REC`, which is
 * exactly why they were rendering over the pill's blur. The date and the clock
 * keep the bottom row to themselves and stay.
