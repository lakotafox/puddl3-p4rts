 * the usual 97px, the lead paragraph beside it on a 667px measure — **Chakra
 * Petch 32/1.2**, with alternate clauses at half strength, which is what gives
 * the paragraph its rhythm — and three `#dbfffe` cards across the foot, 331 tall
 * on a 16px gutter, each with a black 66px tile at the top-left and its copy on
 * a 341px measure at the bottom. Every inset in a card is **32px**.
 *
 * The heading resolves out of a blur when the panel arrives and scatters back
 * into one when it leaves — see [[components/common|`<ScatterText>`]] — and the
 * three cards **rise into it one after another**, on a trail rather than three
 * delays: a trail is one spring pulling the next, so the row arrives as a run
 * of movement instead of three things landing on a metronome. They leave the
 * same way, in the same order, which is what makes the panel read as one object
 * rather than as a slide with contents.
 *
 * > [!important] It is a **column**, not four absolutely-placed boxes
 * > Every number above is still here — the 97px head, the 60px margins, the
 * > 50px footing, the 331px row on its 16px gutter — but they are now padding
 * > and a height on a `justify-between` column rather than four independent
 * > `top`/`bottom` offsets. Absolutely placed, the head and the foot of this
 * > panel were pinned to opposite edges of *whatever shape the window is*: on a
 * > 3:4 tablet that left a third of the panel as a black band in the middle, and
 * > on a phone the three cards were 69px wide with 32px of padding in them. A
 * > column can do what neither of those can — stack at one width, sit in a row
 * > at another, and give back the space between when there is none to give.
