 * window, one pushing the last one out of the top, and the last of them carries
 * on up and out as the closing shot is revealed. Nothing behind them has to be
 * dressed for the join, because nothing behind them can be seen.

 * One number does all of it: `offset` runs `0` (all below the window) through
 * `1` (the first panel covering) and `2` (the second) to `panels.length + 1`
 * (all gone), and panel `k` sits at `(k + 1 − offset) × (100% + GAP)`. They are
 * laid **one window plus `GAP` apart** — see that constant — and what shows in
 * the gap is the black layer the finale leaves up, not the room.
 *
 * `fixed` and driven by the scroll rather than placed in the flow: the scene is
 * a canvas that is `sticky` for the whole page, so what covers it has to be
 * pinned to the window too. Transforms are written **straight to the elements**
 * off the shared ticker — this changes on most frames of two acts, and a
 * re-render per frame to set one number is a re-render too many. React state
