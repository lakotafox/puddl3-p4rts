 * offset, and it turns solid once the wave has passed `its row + its offset`.
 * The randomness is what makes the front a scatter of pixels rather than a
 * ruled line, and because the offsets are drawn once and kept, scrubbing the
 * scroll back and forth replays exactly the same dissolve rather than boiling.
 *
 * **Canvas, not elements.** The same thing in DOM is four thousand `div`s to
 * lay out and style; here it is one node and a few hundred `fillRect`s, and only
 * the rows inside the ragged band are drawn cell by cell at all — everything
 * below the band is one rectangle.
 *
 * Driven imperatively by [[components/common|`<PanelStack>`]]: the wave moves on
 * most frames of an act, and a re-render per frame to set one number is a
 * re-render too many.
