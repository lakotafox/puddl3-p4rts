 * the dock's buttons step it by one, clicking a card brings that card round.
 *
 * The ring is **endless** — `rot` and the target index are unbounded and every

 * **This one is not a spring**, which is the one place the scene's rule bends:
 * it is a thrown object with friction, and the settle is the tail of that same
 * motion. See [[decisions-log]] ADR-0030. It still runs on the shared ticker,
 * and still writes transforms straight to the nodes — a drag fires on every
 * pointer move, and a state round-trip per move would re-render the tree a
 * hundred times a second. React state carries only the index.
