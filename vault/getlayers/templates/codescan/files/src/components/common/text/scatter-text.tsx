 * The brief: *letters appear at random, not left to right — all at once but at
 * different speeds*. That is one spring per letter with a **different config**
 * and a **shared start**, which is exactly the shape [[text-engine]] cannot
 * make: its staggers are single numbers applied by sequential index, and one
 * `letterConfig` covers every letter, so what it produces is always a sweep. A
 * deliberate exception to hard rule #3 — see [[decisions-log]] ADR-0031.
 *
 * Words are kept whole (`whitespace-nowrap` per word) so a line still breaks
 * between words rather than between letters, and the plain string is left in
 * the DOM for screen readers and crawlers while the split copy is
 * `aria-hidden` — the same bargain the text engine's own `seo` prop strikes.
