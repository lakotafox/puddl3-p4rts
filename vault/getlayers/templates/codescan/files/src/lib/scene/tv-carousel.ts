/**
 * @fileoverview The carousel of works — a ring of televisions, and the turning of it.
 *
 * **It is a ring, not a row.** Each member holds a fixed index on it, and what
 * moves is the ring's rotation; a member's *slot* is the signed distance from its
 * index to the front, wrapped into `±count/2`. Turning past the end therefore
 * wraps to the other side with no special case, no re-ordering and no list of
 * "which set is where" to keep in sync — and because the wrap happens at the
 * ring's far side, which is buried in the fog, it is never seen.
 *
 * The slot is a *continuous* number, so the rotation can sit on a spring and
 * every member slides to its new place together.
