/**
 * @fileoverview One television on the carousel.
 *
 * It is a **clone** of one already in the wall, picked by the texture its screen
 * wears. Cloning shares the geometry and the material — including the video
 * texture — so a member costs one more draw call and nothing else: no second
 * decoder, no second upload, and it plays in sync with the one it came from.
 *
 * Its place is not configured. [[tv-carousel]] hands it a **slot** — a signed
 * distance from the front of the ring — every frame, and everything else follows
 * from that: where it stands, which way it faces, whether it is drawn at all.
 * The scroll's entrance blends from a point deep in the fog to wherever that
 * slot currently is, so turning the ring mid-entrance is not a special case.
