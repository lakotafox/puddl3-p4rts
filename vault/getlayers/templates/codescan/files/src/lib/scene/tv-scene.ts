/**
 * @fileoverview The TV-wall WebGL scene — plain three.js, no React inside.
 *
 * React owns the canvas element and this object's lifetime, nothing more: the
 * scene graph, the loader and the frame loop live here so a re-render can never
 * touch them.
 *
 * The three rules it is built around (see the `optimize-3d-scene` skill):
 * one shared rAF for the whole page, render only while the canvas is visible,
 * and one directional key light on top of an image-based light.
