/**
 * @fileoverview Video playing on the television screens.
 *
 * A screen is matched to its clip **by the name of the texture the model already
 * has on it** — `cat.mp4` replaces the texture named `cat`. That keeps the
 * mapping where it belongs, in the model: re-arranging which television shows
 * what is a change in Blender, not in this file, and a screen whose texture has
 * no matching file simply keeps its still image.
 *
 * Screens share materials in the export (eight materials across fourteen
 * screens), so a screen that gets a video also gets its own clone of the
 * material — assigning the texture to the shared one would change every screen
 * using it. Playback itself is shared: one `<video>` and one `VideoTexture` per
 * distinct file, because the decoder and the per-frame upload are the expensive
 * parts.
