/**
 * DNA Ink — scene settings.
 *
 * Ported verbatim from the `dna-ink.html` reference sketch (the values the
 * in-browser control panel produced). This module is the single source of truth
 * for the look: every number below is fed to a shader uniform in `scene.ts`, so
 * tuning the scene means editing this file — never the render code.
 *
 * Amethyst / violet jewel palette on white paper. A rotating DNA double helix
 * continuously sheds ink-in-water plumes: every ink point is born on the strand,
 * then advected outward by an evolving simplex-noise flow, growing and fading
 * like dye diffusing through water.
