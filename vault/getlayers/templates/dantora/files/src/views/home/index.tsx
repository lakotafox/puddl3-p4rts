 * Home view — a Server Component assembling the PUDDL3 landing page.

 * Sections run in Figma order and take their copy through props from
 * `src/data/mocks/home.ts`, so nothing is hardcoded in a component.
 *
 * The two overlay reveals are pure flow order, no scroll listeners: Services
 * and Team are `sticky`, and the blocks after them carry the page background
 * plus a higher `z-index`, so scrolling lifts each one over the block it
 * follows.
