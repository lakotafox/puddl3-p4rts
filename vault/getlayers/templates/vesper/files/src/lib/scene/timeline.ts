/**
 * Scene timeline — the 0→4 progress clock that drives the WebGL scene and HUD.
 *
 * Four full-viewport scroll tracks each contribute a clamped 0→1 progress; the
 * global clock is their sum. Track 4 measures track 3 against the viewport
 * *bottom* rather than its top, which makes it resolve to the same value as
 * track 2. The clock is therefore `p1 + 2·p2 + p3` and advances at double rate
 * across its middle segment. That shape is load-bearing — the keyframes below
 * were authored against it.
 *
 * The scene samples this store imperatively inside `useFrame`, so it is a plain
 * mutable singleton rather than React state: a per-frame `setState` would drive
 * a re-render on every animation frame.
