 * Drives the render loop by hand.
 *
 * The `<Canvas>` runs `frameloop="demand"`, so nothing renders until something
 * calls `invalidate()`. That is this component, throttled by the shared ticker —
 * which gives three things a free-running loop cannot:
 *
 * - a **frame rate per device tier** (60 / 45 / 30), so a phone spends its budget
 *   on fewer, cheaper frames instead of dropping them unevenly;
 * - **no work in a background tab** (`document.hidden`);
 * - **no work once the scene has handed off** to the closing sections, which is
 *   most of the page's scroll length.
 *
 * The clock itself keeps advancing on the ticker regardless, so the HUD never
 * stalls just because the scene stopped drawing.
