/**
 * The Figma "Send Request" CTA — a filled block plus the arrow tile beside it.
 *
 * Shared by {@link Hero} and {@link SectionBrain}, which rendered it identically.
 *
 * The pointer meets the whole `<Link>` (the block **and** the arrow), but the fill
 * lives on the inner `<span>` — which is why `usePressable` hands back `bind` and
 * `style` separately. Springing the span alone would leave the arrow inert, so the
 * button would fail to light up from a third of its own hit area.
 *
 * The block has no `bg-*` / `text-*` class: the spring owns those colours, and an
 * inline spring value beats a utility anyway. Declaring both would just be a lie
 * in the markup.
