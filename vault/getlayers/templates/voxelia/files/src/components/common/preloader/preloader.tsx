/**
 * Load curtain: a white field that a pixel wave floods with the hero's blues
 * from the centre out, with a counter in the corner.
 *
 * **The curtain does the whole reveal.** Nothing under it animates — the page
 * is rendered opaque from the first paint and simply becomes visible as the
 * curtain clears. Two reasons that matters:
 *
 * - Fading `<main>` in would leave the content at `opacity: 0` in the server
 *   render, which is exactly what [[seo-metadata]] warns against.
 * - "Appearing through blur" is done with `backdrop-filter` on the curtain, not
 *   `filter` on a wrapper. Any non-`none` `filter` makes its element a
 *   containing block for `position: fixed` descendants, which would tear the
 *   controls panel and the 3D cursor out of the viewport — permanently, since
 *   even `blur(0px)` counts.
 *
 * The wave is drawn the same way as the background field it hands over to: one
 * device pixel per cell, scaled up with `image-rendering: pixelated`, quantised
 * to the same handful of shades.
