/**
 * The hero headline, set letter by letter.
 *
 * One `TextEngine` per data line rather than one for the whole string: the
 * design's break is content, not a consequence of the column width, and giving
 * each line its own engine is also what lets `whitespace-nowrap` hold a line
 * together from `sm` up without the other one being dragged along.
 *
 * Two details that are load-bearing here:
 *
 * - **No `overflow`.** The clip is the usual way to hide letters before they
 *   slide in, but it clips to the *line-height* box, and this headline is set at
 *   80% leading on purpose. Under `overflow` that shaves the glyphs — see
 *   [[text-engine]]. Fading and translating without a clip gets the same read at
 *   this size and stays honest about the leading.
 * - **`enabled` is the curtain's `done` flag.** The engine would otherwise play
 *   its whole stagger while the load curtain is still opaque, and the headline
 *   would simply be *there* when the curtain lifted.
